**Hi! I am Jie Wang (王颉)**, a junior undergraduate student majoring in **Computer Science and Technology** at the [College of Computer Science](https://cs.bjut.edu.cn) & [Fan-Gongxiu Honors College](https://fgx-hc.bjut.edu.cn), [Beijing University of Technology (BJUT)](https://www.bjut.edu.cn).  

I am currently a Research Assistant at the [**Beijing Institute of Artificial Intelligence**](https://biai.bjut.edu.cn), advised by [**Associate Researcher Jinduo Liu**](https://duo67.github.io). My research focuses on **Multimodal Learning**, **Large Language Model (LLM) Security**, and **Reinforcement Learning**. 

In the summer of 2025, I visited **North Carolina State University (NCSU)** as a Research Assistant under **Dr. Muhammad Shahzad**, where our work on WiFi-based gesture recognition won **1st Place in the Poster Symposium (1/50)**.
